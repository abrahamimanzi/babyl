Insufficient documentation will prevent direct settlements and may result in the account being billed to you. Any shortfalls in benefit are your responsibility. Should your insurer determine that the care and treatment is not covered, or not fully covered, under your insurance policy, you agree that you will be liable for the portion of the charges that are not settled by the insurer.</p><br>

                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">1.1           Certain Practitioners are employed by the Company and other Practitioners are independent third parties.  The Company has taken reasonable steps to verify the identity of Practitioners against their regulatory body’s database of members and in the normal course of events will use reasonable efforts to verify certain background information about a Practitioner.  However, the Company makes no representation or guarantee in relation to, and is not responsible for, the qualifications of any Practitioner or the suitability of any Practitioner that is not an employee of the Company.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">1.2           Consultations are subject to Practitioner availability. When you place an order for a consultation with a Practitioner, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to offer a consultation within a reasonable period of time, but the Company does not guarantee to offer a consultation within a particular time frame.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">1.3           By using a text, audio and/or video consultation, you consent to the use of a remote service.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">1.4           You acknowledge that while the Company takes all reasonable precautions, due to the nature of electronic communications the security of a remote interaction cannot be guaranteed.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">1.5           You understand and agree that consultations with GPs and Nurses may be limited to 10 minutes in duration and that consultations with Specialist may be limited to 20 minutes in duration.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">1.6           Advice, information or other communications given or made remotely by audio or video are by their nature limited relative to a face-to-face consultation.  A non-face to face consultation may therefore not be sufficient in certain circumstances and Users should be aware of, and by using the Company’s App and any other facility are deemed to have accepted, those limitations. In particular, a non-face to face consultation is unlikely to be appropriate or sufficient in circumstances of: (i) emergency, (ii) urgency, (iii) where a physical examination is likely to be required, (iv) where physical intervention is likely to be required, or (v) where the problem, issue or information required is not suited to remote communication.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">1.7           It is the responsibility of the User to evaluate whether any advice received via the Services is suitable or sufficient for the User’s needs, to what extent the User should rely upon it and whether the User should seek the assistance of their GP, other medical practitioner or emergency services.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">1.8           If, following use of the App, you are in any doubt, or have any concerns regarding any information or advice you have received or failed to receive via the Services, or regarding your health, wellbeing or any conditions, you agree to seek further medical opinion from a registered GP or suitable healthcare professional not affiliated with the Services and/or shall utilise the emergency services as applicable.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">1.9           You acknowledge and agree that when using the Company’s “Ask A Question” (also known as “Ask”) Service, which may from time to time enable you to send a textual question to a Practitioner: (i) the Company makes no guarantee, warranty or undertaking regarding the timeframe within which you should expect to receive a reply, if at all; (ii) any replies are for general informational purposes only; replies are not intended and may not be treated as personalised health advice for the User; and (iii) follow-up questions from the User may not receive a reply.</p><br>
                    <h5 class="title-page">2. AMENDMENT OF THE TERMS</h5>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">A User may separately agree terms and conditions with a Practitioner in relation to the Terms upon which that Practitioner is willing to provide services to the User.  If that is the case, such agreement shall not affect these terms to the extent they apply to the relationship between the User and the Company.</p><br>
                    <h5 class="title-page">3.  COMMITMENT TO YOU</h5>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">3.1           Each of our Practitioners who is a GP has committed:</p><br>

                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">(b)        to volunteer where requested their name and General Medical Council / Irish Medical Council professional registration number when prescribing medicines and communicating with patients;</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">(c)        to prescribe medicines only when in their professional judgment it is in the patient's best interests to receive the medicine being requested and, accordingly, to refuse to prescribe medicines when they believe it is not in the patient's best interests to receive medicines without the benefit of a face to face consultation; and</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">(d)        to take all reasonable steps to protect patients' personal information.</p><br>

                    <h5 class="title-page">1. The Terms And This Schedule</h5>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">The purpose of these terms, and how they relate to babyl's other terms and conditions.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">The terms in this Schedule apply to the babyl "CHECK" app which is referred to in this Schedule as "the App". The rest of the Terms also apply to use of the App and references in those terms to "the App" are references to the "CHECK" app in the context of this Schedule.</p><br>
                    <h5 class="title-page">2. Operating System Requirements</h5>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">The technical requirements for using the App.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">2.1 The App requires an iPhone version 4S or more recent, running iOS 8 or higher, or an Android smartphone running Android v4.2 or more recent ("Devices"), and a consistent 3G (or faster) data connection. For the avoidance of doubt, GPRS or EDGE connections are not suitable.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">2.2 We recommend that if you are using a wireless network to access the App, you avoid use of public wi-fi facilities in favour of a personal wi-fi connection, and that the wireless network is secured with WPA-2 security. We recommend that the Device from which you access the App is password protected, set to lock after a short period of inactivity, and protected with suitable anti-virus and anti-malware software.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">2.3 From time to time, updates to the App may be made available to you. We recommend that you use the latest version of the App at all times, to take advantage of the latest enhancements.</p><br>
                    <h5 class="title-page">3. Acknowledgements</h5>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">The App includes software and content which the Company does not provide.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">3.1 If any open-source software is included in the App or any Service, the terms of an open-source licence may override some of the terms of this end user licence.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">3.2 The App may contain links to other independent third-party websites ("Third-party Sites"). Third-party Sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and do not endorse their content or their privacy policies (if any). You will need to make your own independent judgement regarding your interaction with any Third-party Sites, including the purchase and use of any products or services accessible through them.</p><br>
                    <h5 class="title-page">4. Your Use Of The App</h5>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">What the App does, and what you can rely on it to provide. Also, when you shouldn't use the App.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.1 The Company provides the App to you.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.2 The App provides a symptom checking tool which provides you with a suggestion for where to seek care for diagnosis and treatment, based on the symptoms you enter. In some cases, particularly those that do not yet require seeking care from a healthcare provider, general healthcare advice, possible conditions, and non-prescribed treatments may be suggested. Any conditions suggested should not be considered as a definitive diagnosis as this can only be obtained after speaking to a suitably qualified healthcare professional. The aim is to enable you to identify the medical services or simple home treatment advice that most closely matches your needs, based on the information you enter into the App.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.3 The suggestions provided are only valid for immediate action. If you delay immediate action for any reason, you will need to enter new information into the App which should represent correct information at the time of data entry rather than historical information based on how you were feeling the previous time you entered the information. This is very important, as the advice the App provides is based on the information you enter, and your symptoms are likely to change over time and you may develop new symptoms.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.4 The suggestions provided do not cover all clinical situations, including but not limited to those listed in paragraph 4.6. Suggestions provided are dependent on the body part selected. You are responsible for the selection of body parts in the App and the Company cannot be held liable for any adverse event resulting from advice provided for an inappropriately selected body part or by using the suggested outcome for conditions not covered by the App, including but not limited to those listed in paragraph 4.6.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.5 The App is not a medical consultation and does not provide a definitive diagnosis or any prescribed treatment. It suggests healthcare providers or non-prescribed treatment that may suit your current healthcare needs. If you require a medical consultation, you should consult a healthcare professional and not use the App. You can obtain remote medical consultations by subscribing to the Company's babyl app.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.6 The app is not designed for use:</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.6.1 by anyone under 16;</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.6.2 outside the United Kingdom;</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.6.3 by pregnant women;</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.6.4 by people who have a chronic disease or condition;</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.6.5 by people who have recently had surgery;</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.6.6 by people who are generally unwell with co-existing illnesses or undiagnosed conditions (apart from the symptoms for which they are consulting the App).</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">You should not use the App if you fall into any of these categories.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.7 The Company does not provide the medical services or treatment that the App may suggest, nor does it recommend any named provider or supplier of non-prescribed treatment. The providers of such services or treatments (and not the Company) are responsible to you for their services or treatments. You should always read the instruction label for any medications suggested before use. Do not take any medications if you have any concerns after reading the label. If you are unsure, consult a doctor before use.</p><br>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">4.8 In cases where the App suggests seeking further care, you are responsible for making appointments, and ensuring these occur within the recommended time frame. The first available appointment within a recommended time frame is advised in all circumstances. If you are advised to use a health service "as soon as possible", this is intended to mean within the next few days. Where a babyl appointment is recommended, and you are not able to book this for any reason, you should seek care from an alternative provider such as your NHS GP.</p><br>
                    <h5 class="title-page">5. Our Use Of Data And Permissions</h5>
                    <p class="gray-color pr-text-2">How the App uses your information.</p><br>
